I wanted a clean, simple home page where I could put my writing, projects and some books recommendation. It had to be fast, mobile-friendly, free to build, and easy to update. This is the result.

See the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
documentation for more info.
